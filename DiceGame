Description: This project involved building a dice game using JavaScript, which features two players rolling two dice. Upon refreshing the page, a new game begins with the dice randomly rolled using the Math functions and floor etc. If one player rolls a higher number, the text displays the winner as either player 1 or 2. If both players roll the same number, the game ends in a draw, and the text displays the draw outcome. The game uses if, if-else statements to determine the winner and query selectors to display the text correctly.
Technology: HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT
